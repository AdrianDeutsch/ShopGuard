**ShopGuard** is a behaviour-driven test-automation framework for a demo web shop and a REST API.
It combines Gherkin scenarios (Reqnroll) with Playwright UI tests, a typed API client and SQL database
validation. Every layer runs **green in CI** — including the full UI suite, executed against a
self-hosted instance of the shop — and the results are published as a clickable
[**live report**](https://adriandeutsch.github.io/ShopGuard/).

> 🇩🇪 The Gherkin scenarios are written in German (the project's domain language); all code and comments are in English.

## ⭐ Highlights

- **Full test pyramid** — 49 unit tests, 16 API/DB scenarios, 11 UI scenarios.
- **UI E2E gated by a git hook** — the [`pre-push`](.githooks/pre-push) hook runs the full Playwright
  suite against a **self-hosted Toolshop** before every push. This is the deliberate fix for an upstream
  constraint: the public demo is Cloudflare-protected and the self-hostable images are arm64-only, so the
  suite runs where it works (the dev machine) instead of being faked in the cloud (no bot-evasion).
- **Fast, always-green push pipeline** — hosted CI runs unit + API + DB + report in ~1–2 minutes.
- **99.6 % line coverage** on the reusable core, enforced and reported every push.
- **Clickable live documentation** (BDD scenarios + coverage) auto-deployed to GitHub Pages.
- **Fail-fast pyramid**: unit tests gate everything; no browser starts if they are red.
- **Failure forensics**: screenshot + Playwright trace captured automatically and uploaded as CI artifacts.

## ✨ Features

| Area | Status | Technology |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ UI E2E tests (11 scenarios) | green (local `pre-push` gate) | Playwright for .NET, Page Object Model |
| ✅ API tests (14 scenarios) | green in CI | Typed `HttpClient` client against restful-booker |
| ✅ Unit tests (49 tests, < 1 s) | green in CI | NUnit 4 + Moq, mocked `HttpMessageHandler` |
| ✅ SQL validation (2 scenarios) | green in CI | SQLite + Dapper, ANSI-compatible schema |
| ✅ Code coverage ≥ 80 % | 99.6 % | Coverlet + ReportGenerator |
| ✅ CI/CD with tag selection | live | GitHub Actions (+ portable `.gitlab-ci.yml`) |
| ✅ Living documentation + coverage | published | GitHub Pages |
| ✅ Screenshots + traces on failure | active | Playwright tracing, CI artifacts |

**Targets:** UI against the [Toolshop](https://practicesoftwaretesting.com) (stable `data-test` selectors),
API against [restful-booker](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com).

## 🏗 Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["Gherkin features<br/>(.feature, DE)"] --> B["Step definitions<br/>Reqnroll + NUnit"]
  B --> C["Page objects"]
  B --> D["BookingApiClient<br/>ShopGuard.Core"]

  C --> F["Playwright<br/>Chromium"]
  D --> G["restful-booker API"]
  E --> H["(SQLite Orders)"]
  I["Hooks: screenshot + trace on failure"] -.-> F
```

Reusable logic (API client, price calculation, test-data generator, config loader, order repository)
lives in `ShopGuard.Core` and is fully unit-tested — the E2E layer stays thin.

## 🚀 Quick start

1. **Clone & build**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdrianDeutsch/ShopGuard.git && cd ShopGuard
   dotnet build ShopGuard
   ```
2. **Install the Playwright browser** (once)
   ```bash
   dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.Playwright.CLI
   pwsh ShopGuard/ShopGuard.E2ETests/bin/Debug/net10.0/playwright.ps1 install chromium
   ```
3. **Run the unit tests** (< 1 second)
   ```bash
   dotnet test ShopGuard/ShopGuard.UnitTests
   ```
4. **Run the API + DB suite**
   ```bash
   dotnet test ShopGuard/ShopGuard.E2ETests --filter "TestCategory=api|TestCategory=db"
   ```
5. **Run the UI suite** against your own Toolshop (no Cloudflare):
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/toolshop.compose.yml up -d
   docker compose -f docker/toolshop.compose.yml exec -T laravel-api php artisan migrate:fresh --seed --force
   SHOPGUARD_ENV=selfhosted dotnet test ShopGuard/ShopGuard.E2ETests --filter "TestCategory=ui"
   ```
   Watch the browser live with `HEADLESS=false`.
6. **Enable the UI quality gate** (runs the suite above automatically before every push):
   ```bash
   git config core.hooksPath .githooks
   ```
   Bypass once when needed with `SKIP_UI_TESTS=1 git push`.

## 🎯 Test strategy

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph Pyramid
    UI["🖥 UI E2E — 11 scenarios<br/>slow, highest fidelity"]
    API["🔌 API + DB — 16 scenarios<br/>fast, contract & persistence"]
    UNIT["⚙️ Unit — 49 tests<br/>< 1 s, gates everything"]
  end
  UNIT --> API --> UI
```

**Tagging** (Reqnroll tags → NUnit categories → `--filter "TestCategory=..."`):

| Tag | Meaning | Where it runs |
|---|---|---|
| `@api` / `@db` | API + database layer | hosted CI, every push & PR |
| `@ui` | Playwright UI layer | local `pre-push` hook (self-hosted shop) |
| `@smoke` | critical path, fast | filter for a quick local/CI subset |
| `@e2e` | complete order flow (login → checkout) | part of `@ui` |
| `@wip` | in progress / unstable ([FLAKY-TESTS.md](FLAKY-TESTS.md)) | nowhere |

## 🐳 UI tests: self-hosted shop + local git hook

The UI suite needs a running shop, but neither demo shop can be driven from hosted CI:

- the **public** Toolshop (and the original demo.nopcommerce.com) sits behind a **Cloudflare bot
  challenge** that triggers for data-center IPs, and
- the **self-hostable** Toolshop images are **arm64-only** — on amd64 GitHub runners the API container
  fails with `exec format error`, so the app never gets its data.

Rather than evade the bot protection or fight emulation, the UI suite runs **where it works — the developer
machine** (arm64-native, or any host that can run the images), via a git **`pre-push` hook**:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks   # enable once
```

On every `git push`, [`.githooks/pre-push`](.githooks/pre-push) starts the self-hosted Toolshop
([docker/toolshop.compose.yml](docker/toolshop.compose.yml) — Angular UI + Laravel API + MariaDB), seeds
the database, and runs the `@ui` scenarios against `http://localhost:4200` (the `selfhosted` environment).
A red suite blocks the push; bypass deliberately with `SKIP_UI_TESTS=1 git push`. The hosted CI stays
fast and green with unit + API + DB + report.

This mirrors how you'd test a real product: against a disposable, seeded instance you control —
deterministic data, no external flakiness, no third-party rate limits.

## 🔁 CI/CD pipeline

The pipeline runs live on **GitHub Actions** ([ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml)); a fully equivalent
**[.gitlab-ci.yml](.gitlab-ci.yml)** (stages, tag selection, GitLab Pages) ships alongside it.

<details>
<summary><b>Jobs & triggers</b> (click to expand)</summary>

| Job | Trigger | Content | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `unit` | every push / PR | 49 unit tests + coverage | **fail-fast** — red ⇒ nothing else runs |
| `api` | needs unit | `@api` + `@db` | restful-booker + SQLite, retry on flakiness |
| `pages` | push to `main` | Living doc + coverage → GitHub Pages | published report |
| `pre-push` hook (local) | every `git push` | `@ui` via self-hosted Toolshop | runs where arm64 images work; see above |

## 🐞 Defect management

Three real, documented defects (template: [JIRA-BUG-TEMPLATE.md](docs/JIRA-BUG-TEMPLATE.md)):

| ID | Component | Summary | Root cause |
|---|---|---|---|
| [DEFECT-001](docs/defects/DEFECT-001.md) | API | `POST /booking` returns **418** instead of 4xx without an Accept header | product bug |
| [DEFECT-002](docs/defects/DEFECT-002.md) | API | `POST /auth` returns **200** for invalid credentials | product bug |
| [DEFECT-003](docs/defects/DEFECT-003.md) | UI | Checkout blocked: house number from registration missing in profile | product bug |

Workflow: failure analysis (trace/logs) → classification (product / test / flaky) → report → fix or workaround → retest.

---

## 🎁 Bonus: Playwright with TypeScript

Selected UI scenarios are also ported to **Playwright Test (TypeScript)** — same Page Object structure,
same `data-test` selectors:

```bash
cd playwright-ts
npm install && npx playwright install chromium
npx playwright test
```
